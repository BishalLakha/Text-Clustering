push towards the coastal town of zawiyah zawiyah which lies  km  miles west of tripoli has been the scene of two uprisings which were smashed by gaddafis security forces a large contingent of the rebels fighting around bir alghanam are from zawiyah most analysts say gaddafi will eventually be forced to relinquish power if nato states and their rebel allies maintain the pressure on him by starving him of weapons fuel and cash and attacking his forces however some alliance members are unsettled by how long the libyan campaign is dragging on and how much it is costing especially at a time of economic uncertainty if nato wavers this could give gaddafi an opportunity to hold on to power for now though there is no sign of a letup in the air campaign led by french and british warplanes a reuters reporter in tripoli said there were multiple strikes overnight in the southeast of the city in a separate operation on sunday british apache attack helicopters took off from a

heightened military operations and violence in hama deir alzour and other parts of the country which have led to the death of dozens of civilians and the destruction of many publically and privatelyowned buildings the arab league charter rejects foreign interference in arab affairs and ensures the safety and security and political stability of its member countries he stressed he also

tolerate after similar demonstrations in hama the authorities seem to be warning the rest of the country by attacking another city which dares to challenge the power of president assad pressure from the united nations and the international community doesnt seem to he having an effect the crackdown has expanded to include prominent opposition figures like former political prisoner walid albunni

if it says it will mr assad is fighting an insurgency that grew out of street protests  months ago and has escalated into a civil war in which  people have been killed his overstretched army has lost swathes of territory and relies on air power to keep rebels at bay if this humble initiative succeeds we hope that we can build on it in order to discuss a longer and more effective ceasefire and this has to be part of a comprehensive political process he said syrias foreign ministry later said that a final decision about a ceasefire would be taken on thursday the army command is studying the cessation of military operations during the eid holiday and the final decision will be taken tomorrow a ministry statement said  of  a crowd gathers in front of damaged buildings after a car bomb

military said it had responded to attacks by insurgents on army positions in line with its announcement on thursday that it would cease military activity during the fourday holiday but reserved the right to react to rebel actions brahimis ceasefire appeal had won widespread international support including from russia china and iran president assads main foreign allies the unarab league envoy had hoped to build on the truce to calm a monthold conflict that has killed an estimated  people and worsened instability in the middle east violence appeared to wane in some areas but truce breaches by both sides swiftly marred syrians hopes of celebrating eid aladha the climax of the haj pilgrimage to mecca in peace we are not celebrating eid here said a woman in a besieged syrian town near the turkish border speaking above the noise of incessant gunfire and shelling no one is in the mood to celebrate everyone is just glad they are alive un chief ban kimoon on monday renewed his appeal to syrian president bashar alassad to stop the violence against civillians after reports of a new military crackdown just a day earlier ban speaking to reporters in northeast japan said that he had

known as anonymous appears to have vandalized the website of the syrian ministry of defense visitors to the website early monday morning were greeted with the green white and black stripes and red stars of the syrian flag after a few moments the anonymous logo appears in the middle of the flag above the following text in english and arabic to the syrian people the world stands with you against the brutal regime of bashar alassad know that time and history are on your side  tyrants use violence because they have nothing else and the more violent they are the more fragile they become we salute your determination to be nonviolent in the face of the regimes brutality and admire your willingness to pursue justice not mere revenge all tyrants will fall and thanks to your bravery bashar alassad is next to the syrian military you are responsible for protecting the syrian people and anyone who orders you to kill women children and the elderly deserves to be tried for treason no outside enemy could do as much damage to syria as bashar alassad has done defend your country  rise up against the regime  anonymous a member of anonymous who was involved in the attack on the ministry website told the huffington post monday morning that the action was part of a broader effort by the looselyaffiliated group to focus on political targets there are various things in the works  pretty much anything standing in the way of democratic governance human rights and the rule of law is in the crosshairs the hacker said that includes everybody from the koch brothers to mahmoud ahmedinejad he went on the ministry of defense was targeted because it represents the syrian military which is the key moving part in the ongoing uprising there if the military turns against the regime the regime is toast anonymous had previously announced that they would begin targeting the websites of syrian embassies around the world but todays attack was the first to target an official government website in the country according to pc magazine much of anonymouss previous work has centered on large corporations like visa and sony but in june the organization announced it was joining forces with the politically oriented hacker group lulzsec to focus more on government websites reports the la times there are absolutely plans to take other sites and do similarly targeted actions the hacker said any regime thats engaged in obviously heinous bullshit is fair game killing unarmed civilians absolutely qualifies as heinous bullshit the hacker group has recently attacked the websites of a number of highprofile institutions earlier in the weekend the group announced it had stolen sensitive data from around  us law enforcement agencies primarily rural police departments the incident occurs as syrian forces continue a series of brutal raids on protesters the violent crackdown has left more than  dead in july president barack obama condemned the syrian regime saying he is appalled by the horrifying reports of violence sanaa june  reuters  talks to resolve yemens political crisis have failed after the deputy to wounded president ali abdullah saleh refused to speak with groups demanding he cede power immediately opposition figures said saleh forced to seek medical treatment in saudi arabia for wounds suffered in an attack on his palace nine days ago has has refused to leave office despite nearly six months of street protests and many diplomatic attempts to remove him the ensuing political paralysis and longstanding conflicts with islamist insurgents separatists and rebel tribesmen has fanned western and regional fears of yemen collapsing into chaos and giving al qaeda a stronghold alongside oil shipping routes a member of the group of opposition parties demanding saleh transfer power now said international efforts to broker an agreement to that end had collapsed because the acting leader vice president abdrabbu mansour hadi would not talk to them the american and european efforts for a dialogue between opposition parties and the ruling party has failed the vicepresident has refused to deal with or meet opposition parties mohammed almutawakkil said he

denouncing the regime after friday prayers if the governments account is true it is by far the biggest number of security forces killed in any single incident since the uprising began in march it implies that at least in jisr alshughour they are facing an armed insurrection rather than mass peaceful protests but some activist internet sites have suggested that some army elements may have defected to the revolt another possible explanation for the sudden startling leap in the number of security forces killed whatever the case it is a massive challenge to the government and it has vowed to meet it with determination and force a report said the fighting had begun at dawn when an armed gang ambushed police as they approached the town to rescue citizens being terrorised twenty officers

bombing rebel held cities like nalut  and theyve threatened to try and retake the nearby border crossing with tunisia  if the rebels were to lose that crossing a run to tripoli would be a near impossibility in the early morning haze the rebels pounded their targets for hours at this range its an artillery war these are soviet made grad rockets seized from gadhafi forces  now aimed right back at those same forces  taibbi the rebels cheered each on target hit though some were reluctant to show their faces with the gadhafi forces hardly vanquished do you know if they have retreated yet gadhafi forces  or are they still there unidentified man  i think theyre still there and they hiding in houses man  and in the farms taibbi but the heavy artillery barrage did the job dozens of these grad rockets and additional shelling by the seized gadhafi army tanks the rebels here have better weapons now including gadhafi s own and better command and control and by midday they heard their ground forces had taken the first town and soon the second they had suffered losses these medics handled one causality how did the man die was he shot or was he  was it a mine or what happened unidentified man  no they shot him taibbi and nalut s hospital treated the wounded from both sides taibbi i was surprised gadhafi s men put up so little resistance this rebel fighter told us but this

hosni mubarak unleashed the chaos he had warned egyptians was the only alternative to his autocratic regime the regimes thugs ran riot in the center of cairo alexandria and other cities wednesday attacking what had been peaceful antigovernment encampments with stones knives and molotov cocktails bahey el din hassan who is one of egypts leading human rights activists is not surprised hassan who for the last quarter century has been one of the relatively small contingent of activists fighting against the abuses of the mubarak regime recognized tactics he has been documenting for years  the use of plainclothes intelligence and security operatives violence directed against peaceful protesters and journalists and most of all the attempt to create a pretext for a still bloodier intervention i was expecting that something like this would happen today hassan told me in an interview in washington because even though he offered the country a deal last night mubaraks statement was not reconciliatory his speech was full of threats and negative interpretations of the demonstrations and immediately after it ended state television began calling for supporters of stability to show their strength hassans cellphone was chiming incessantly during our conversation with calls from his colleagues in cairos tahrir square they are afraid there is a plan to clear the square tonight by any means he said in other words rather than beginning the orderly transition to democracy president obama said should begin now in cairo mubarak may be trying to create the conditions for a massacre  an arab tiananmen square hassan who currently is director of a regional human rights group called the cairo institute for human rights studies left egypt on jan  the day opposition organizers had planned a day of rage against the egyptian government in contrast to tunisias spontaneous uprising egypts was planned but hassan said neither he nor the young leaders of the april  movement who organized that first protest expected such a huge turnout nor did they plan for the demonstrations to continue beyond jan  at first they werent even sure they could continue until friday jan   the day that hundreds of thousands first took to the streets hassan said the massive response he said is very good news but we dont yet have a real breakthroughthere is a lot of maneuvering and manipulation by the regime mubarak he added may still have the capacity to restore order by force hassan watched president obamas statement tuesday night and saw it as a good example of what us policy has been the last two years fine words but no action i think that this administration in practice has supported not only the mubarak regime but all the authoritarian regimes in the arab region he said the cairo speech president obama made two years ago sent a very good message to the arab people but in reality the administration engaged with the regimes at the expense of the people it didnt help the people of the region and it didnt help us longterm interests  and this is what we now see in the streets of cairo some in washington argue that the united states has little ability to affect the outcome of egypts crisis but hassan warned that if mubarak represses the prodemocracy movement or fails to carry out a democratic transition both egyptians and arabs around the region will blame the obama administration rightly of wrongly the egyptian people think the united states is still supporting mubarak he said rightly or wrongly they think the united states has unlimited power to push mubarak to respond positively if he doesnt respond that way that means the united states didnt push or agrees with how he handles the situation cnn  government troops fought street battles with one of yemens

resolve syrias crisis moscow and beijing vetoed in the un security council there was no indication from lavrovs comments that the issue of assad eventually giving up power  a central element of the arab proposal that failed in the council  had been raised assad said he would cooperate with any plan that stabilized syria but made clear that only included an earlier arab league proposal that called for dialogue release of prisoners and withdrawing the army from protest centers walid albunni a senior member of the opposition syrian national council said lavrov brought no new initiative and that socalled reforms promised by assad were not enough the crimes that have been committed have left no room for bashar alassad to remain ruler of syria he told reuters russias mediation also failed to slow a rush by countries that denounced the russianchinese veto three days ago to corner syria diplomatically and cripple assad with sanctions in hopes of toppling him opposition activists said

the crisis and end  months of bloodshed the us closed its embassy in syria on monday and several european countries have recalled their ambassadors the moves came as syrian government forces continued

separately russias ambassador to the un vitaly churkin denied reports that he had threatened qatars prime minister during talks at the un last week someone was trying to drive a wedge between russia and the arab world he said continue reading the main story on the surface sergei lavrovs talks with president assad in damascus dont seem to have produced any kind of breakthrough if things were agreed behind the scenes without being announced that could become apparent in the coming days especially in places like homs where the violence continues unabated but on the face of it there was nothing new in the statements made after the talks though mr lavrov said the syrian leader seemed to have taken on board the need for swift action he remains committed to ending violence from any source  but the syrians have used that formula to cover their crackdown on armed opposition fighters the powers which backed the torpedoed un resolution are not waiting for the russians to pull a

hague said damascus was not in full compliance of the ceasefire requirements of the peace plan negotiated by kofi annan on sunday mr annan described as a pivotal moment the un security councils decision to deploy up to  observers to syria the government in particular must desist from the use of heavy weapons and as it has committed withdraw such weapons and armed units from population centres and implement fully its commitments under the sixpoint plan mr annan the un and arab league envoy to syria added a un supervision mission to syria unsmis advance team arrived in the country in the past week and over the weekend visited the central city of homs which has been under almost constant bombardment since the ceasefire began  days ago opposition and human rights activists said government tanks and artillery opened fired on the arbaeen and mashaa alarbaeen districts of hama which lie to the north of the city centre on monday morning it began in the morning with tanks and artillery there were houses burning a local activist called mousab told reuters news agency by telephone then the military forces entered and shot people in the street the ukbased syrian observatory

opposition activists and a rights activist said as a sixperson advance party of un observers is due to arrive in syria to monitor a ceasefire meant to start four days ago british foreign secretary william hague said that the  unarmed observers who have been sanctioned to enter syria by a unanimous vote at the security council on saturday was insufficient and had to be beefed up this number of people cannot possibly effectively monitor what is happening in the whole country he said in an interview with sky news adding that  monitors could however quickly visit areas where they are reports of ceasefire breaches the plan will be for a much larger team more in the hundreds of monitors to follow them provided the ceasefire plan is being implemented by all concerned he said but four days after a ceasefire was meant to come into effect violence persists early this morning we saw a helicopter and a spotter plane fly overhead ten minutes later there was heavy shelling said walid alfares an activist living in the battered homs district of khalidiya activist video footage reportedly from khalidiya shows an explosion shortly after the sound of a missile flying through the air another

rights said shells were being fired at a rate of one a minute he said there had also been overnight clashes in rural aleppo people said they heard explosions and shooting after rebels attacked a police station and then clashed with police he said syria blames the violence on terrorists seeking to topple president bashar alassad and has repeatedly denied journalists access to the country making it impossible to independently verify the reports the first members of a un monitoring team have arrived in syria a un spokesman said early monday four days after a socalled ceasefire that is showing serious signs of collapse the six monitors arrived sunday in damascus and will begin their work monday morning said kieran dwyer a spokesman for peacekeeping missions at the united nations they will be liaising with the syrian government security forces and the opposition members to establish the monitoring process across the country dwyer said the first members of the advance team arrived a day after the un security council voted unanimously to authorize unarmed observers to travel to syria to monitor the shaky ceasefire the member council approved the deployment of an advance team of  monitors meant to pave the way for a larger group of up to  observers calling on syria to provide them unimpeded freedom of movement the remaining  members of the advance team will arrive in damascus in the coming days dwyer said the second larger deployment rests on how the ceasefire holds and whether discussions between syria and unarab league envoy kofi annan can make headway to quell the bloodshed still the resolution marks the security councils first on syria since the conflict gripping the country broke out more than a year ago un secretarygeneral ban kimoon pledged to try to develop by wednesday a more concrete proposal for an official and likely more broadly defined observer mission bouthaina shaaban a syrian government spokeswoman and presidential adviser said sunday

determined to defend you and your territory to anyone who would want to attack turkey we say dont even think about it  the move is in response to the spilling over of the syrian civil war into turkey

defenses against syrian threats the united states germany and netherlands which all have patriot capabilities have signaled they would be willing to contribute missiles rasmussen believes the actual deployment will take place within weeks we welcome the intention of germany the netherlands and the united states to provide patriot missile batteries subject to their respective national procedures these systems will be under the operational command of the supreme allied commander europe any deployment will be defensive only it will in no way support a nofly zone or any offensive operation rasmussen said the decision was made as news surfaced about fears of bashar alassads government using chemical weapons rasmussen echoed warnings from us president barack obama that the syrian government may be toying with the idea of using chemical weapons to crush the month rebellion the syrian stockpiles of chemical weapons are a matter of great concern rasmussen told reporters we know that syria possesses missiles we know they have chemical weapons and of course they also have to be included in our calculations and this is also the reason why it is a matter of urgency to ensure

president bashar alassads government says it is protecting from terrorist extremists these are not the first attacks in jaramana to have been blamed on those seeking to overthrow the government but in the past the armed opposition has denied any involvement and repeatedly said it is targeting mr assads forces and not minority groups areas like jaramana are heavily guarded by progovernment militia known as popular committees the conflict in syria is rapidly taking on a sectarian dimension earlier this month similar attacks took place in progovernment alawite districts like mezzeh  and woroud

people had died and  had been seriously injured the syrian observatory for human rights sohr a ukbased activist group put the death toll at  including women and children it said it had so far identified  of the victims and that the death toll would probably rise syrian state tv says the authorities have released  people detained during the ninemonthold uprising against president bashar alassad the prisoners had been involved in recent incidents but their hands were not stained with blood a report said the un says more than  people are in detention and  have been killed as a result of the states crackdown arab league monitors are continuing to deploy as they oversee a peace plan but there are reports of fresh violence at least seven people have been killed so far on wednesday in a number of towns and cities activists said the head of the observer mission has described what he has seen so far as reassuring and nothing frightening dismaying some activists and western observers the state tv news flash announcing the prisoner release on wednesday said only that those affected did not have syrian blood on their hands it did not mention where the protesters were arrested or detained continue reading the main story in one part of homs in a video posted on the internet by activists a crowd of angry mourners gathers around the bonnet of a white vehicle which has the insignia of the arab league emblazoned on it and appears to belong to the observers they lay the lifeless body of a small boy on the bonnet  the commentator shouts that it belongs to fiveyearold ahmad these are our martyrs he shouts to the arab league and theyre being killed in front of your observers activists say the violence has continued despite the presence of the observers but despite the reservations of many activists about the arab mission and some glitches on the ground the observers do seem to have got through unaccompanied by syrian official security escorts to some of the worstaffected quarters of homs in november the government announced that it had freed  prisoners citing similar conditions but earlier this month un high commissioner for human rights navi pillay said tens of thousands of people had been arrested and more than  were reported to be in detention as a result of the crackdown more arab league observers are due to arrive in syria as renewed violence hits the central city of homs at least  people died in gunfire and shelling on monday the syrian observatory for human rights says syrias main opposition group has urged observers arriving as part of a deal to try to end the violence gripping the country to visit the volatile city damascus says it is fighting armed gangs the clampdown has killed more than  people says the un the latest bloodshed is reported to have taken place in the baba amr district of homs which is reportedly besieged by government forces a number of people have been killed in the town by mortar shelling and machine gun fire over the last few days activists say it is expected to be one of the first destinations for the arab observer mission the bbcs jim muir in beirut says that homs may well prove to be a test case for the mission in terms of ascertaining whether they truly have unrestricted access and whether there is any peace for them to monitor protests against the government of president bashar alassad first erupted in march casualty figures are hard to verify as most foreign media are banned from reporting in syria continue reading the main story the mission is getting under way in earnest now syria has said it is responsible for the security of the arab observers so it remains to be seen how free their access to trouble spots will be the head of the arab league nabil alarabi has said it will take about a week to judge whether syria really is complying with the agreement it signed under which the observers are to monitor a complete halt to the violence the withdrawal of armed forces and the release of all detainees of whom there are many thousands in advance of the observers arrival activists accused the authorities of moving detainees onto military bases  where the observers are not allowed to go  and also of removing hundreds of bodies of killed protesters from the morgue at homs fierce fighting has been reported in the strategic syrian town of qusair as rebels and government forces backed by hezbollah militants fight for control the state news agency reported that the army had taken control of most of the town on monday and killed more than  of what it called terrorists activists denied that qusair had been captured but said some  people had died in heavy shelling since sunday they also said at least  hezbollah fighters from lebanon had been killed qusair a small town about km  miles southwest of the city of homs is seen as important to both sides it helps link damascus with government strongholds on the mediterranean coast and is a conduit for rebel supplies and fighters from lebanon whose border is km  miles away fighting has raged for weeks around qusair which has been controlled by the opposition to president bashar alassad for several months continue reading the main story what appears to be a concerted government attempt to recapture qusair from the rebels had been in the making for some time in a sense qusair had already fallen militarily since the rebels appear to have lost control of most of the surrounding villages and countryside adjacent to the lebanese border it adds to a string of setbacks rebels have suffered in recent weeks especially along the lebanese and jordanian borders and around damascus itself rebel commanders blame their recent losses on the dryingup of arms supplies from outside qatar and others are reported to have recently cut deliveries perhaps in response to us reservations about enabling a victory by a rebel movement in which the alqaedalinked nusra front is playing a lead role certainly the government forces bolstered by apparently openended support from russia iran and hezbollah have in recent weeks had a new spring in their step following a day of heavy bombardment by aircraft and artillery the army launched an offensive to recapture the town on sunday by the evening they had taken the municipality building in the town centre and were advancing according to state media the claim was denied by opposition activists although they admitted the rebels had suffered very heavy casualties they posted video on the internet showing chaotic scenes at what they said was a field hospital filled with wounded fighters and civilians trapped in the town at least  people have been killed and more than  injured in two suicide car bombings in the heart of syrias capital damascus officials say state tv said suspected alqaeda militants had targeted two security service bases in the kafr sousa area but the opposition said the attacks  which came a day after arab league observers arrived  were staged by the government to justify its crackdown correspondents say the attacks mark a significant escalation of violence the arab league team are tasked with monitoring whether the government complies with a peace agreement that orders all troops to withdraw from the streets with the aim of ending the violence but human rights and opposition activists said the killings continued on friday with security forces shooting dead at least  civilians more than  people have been killed and thousands more detained since antigovernment protests erupted in march the un says continue reading the main story the two explosions are unprecedented many people were surprised that within  minutes the government had ascertained that the blasts were the results of alqaeda attacks it is hard to tell what the reaction of the syrian government will be after days of major assaults by the security forces in the jabal alzawiya area of northern idlib province hundreds of people have been killed there since the government signed a protocol with the arab league allowing for the deployment of an observer mission many are also asking why the blasts happened a day after the observers advance party arrived the opposition and protesters who are once again taking to the streets blame the government saying it is attempting to persuade the observers that there are terrorists operating inside the country the bbcs jim muir in neighbouring lebanon says we may never know who carried out the bombings  but that they were absolutely against the interests of the opposition and played strongly into the hands of the government the two explosions happened within minutes of each other on friday morning rebels in eastern dr congo have advanced to within a few kilometres of the provincial capital goma the m rebels say they have no plans to take the city but residents fear it could fall at any moment the un security council this weekend condemned rebel attacks and demanded an end to outside support for the group noting they were well equipped uk foreign minister william hague has condemned the m advance and urged british citizens to leave goma any british nationals in goma should leave and any in drc should check the fcos updated travel advice he said government forces and united nations troops still control gomas airport but the un says the humanitarian situation is worsening with some  internally displaced people fleeing the fighting the un said more than  fleeing civilians were seen passing near the airport on sunday the rebels captured the town of kibumba km  miles north of goma on saturday and have since edged closer towards the north kivu provincial capital which lies close to the borders with rwanda and uganda the un said its peacekeeping forces monuscu fought advancing rebels throughout sunday using rockets cannon rounds and helicopter gunships although it has deployed  quick reaction units on patrols throughout the city the un describes the situation in goma as extremely tense  of  a syrian man sits near a railway track as he looks across the border fence from the northern syrian town of ras alain into turkey as seen from the turkish border town of ceylanpinar sanliurfa province november   turkey has asked nato to deploy patriot missiles on its territory the alliance said on wednesday to help it defend itself against any syrian attacks sporadic gunfire was heard throughout the day at the border the move highlights ankaras fears that the situation on its border could deteriorate rapidly and echoes its calls for military support during the two gulf wars when nato deployed surfacetoair missiles on its soil in  and  turkey formally made the request after weeks of talks with nato allies about how to shore up security on its km mile border it has repeatedly scrambled fighter jets along the frontier and responded in kind to stray syrian shells flying into its territory the head of nato said the alliance would discuss the request without delay ambassadors from the  nato members convened a meeting at the military alliances brussels headquarters such a deployment would augment turkeys air defense capabilities to defend the population and territory of turkey secretarygeneral anders fogh rasmussen said it would contribute to the deescalation of the crisis along natos southeastern border turkey is reluctant to be drawn into a regional conflict but the proximity to its border of bombing raids is testing its pledge to defend itself it has found itself increasingly isolated and frustrated by a lack of international action a major player in supporting syrias opposition and planning for the postconflict era turkey is worried about syrias chemical weapons the refugee crisis along its border and what it says is syrian support for kurdish militants on its own soil the missile request is totally based on a defensive perspective for the protection of nato territories there is no kind of aggressive intention from our side a turkish government official said adding that the missiles were only one part of the contingency planning our worst case scenario is firstly a huge refugee influx  and secondly what the international community would do if syrians trying to escape to turkey are shot at he said if there are tens of thousands waiting on the border and they are attacked what would be the response one day after syrian rebels accused government forces of a deadly bombing near a hospital in the besieged city of aleppo opposition groups said another  people had been killed in the fighting thursday the majority of those deaths occurred in the syrian capital of damascus and its suburbs according to the syrian observatory for human rights a londonbased opposition group another  were killed in aleppo where some of the heaviest fighting has occurred the month civil war has claimed more than  lives according to the latest tally from the opposition center for documentation of violations in syria the group counts  government soldiers among the dead and the bloodletting has since carried on unabated while also threatening regional stability on wednesday  people died in the strike on a building next to the dar alshifa hospital including two children and a doctor ralib alomar a leader of the yusif alasma rebel group said the strike had targeted the hospital and that the dead included two nurses a doctor was among the dead  one of  people killed in aleppo on wednesday and  across the country dar alshifa is one of the main sources of medical help for people in syrias

against syrian president bashar alassad in march  alassad responded by turning the army and police on the demonstrations syrian warplanes have bombed a damascus suburb as heavy fighting rages for the second day on the outskirts challenging president bashar alassads hold on the capital fighter jets hit the suburb of daraya near the main southern highway where rebels have been battling elite republican guard units the progovernment alekhbariya television said the army had begun a campaign to cleanse daraya of what it described as terrorists the station showed troops on the edge of the town where activists reported  people killed in two days but rebels and activists suggested that president bashar alassads forces were finding it harder to dislodge the rebels than when they last entered the suburb in august after months of slow progress the rebels have in the last few weeks captured several army positions on the outskirts of damascus and outlying regions including a special forces base near aleppo syrias commercial hub rebels have also seized an air defence position near the southern gate of the capital assads opponents are also gaining some support internationally as a newly formed coalition of opposition and rebel groups seeks recognition as the legitimate voice of the syrian people the british royal united services institute shashank joshi said that the developments of the last few weeks were shifting the balance in favour of the rebels fighting was also reported in damascuss eastern suburb of irbin where rebels said they had destroyed one tank and killed two republican guards fresh clashes have broken out in syria despite the passing of a unbacked deadline for a complete withdrawal of government troops and weapons activists reported shelling in homs and areas of northern aleppo province and unrest in the capital damascus rights groups said  people had been killed on tuesday syrias foreign minister walid muallem in russia for talks said damascus had taken steps to adhere to the plan by withdrawing some troops he blamed armed gangs for the continuing violence under the peace plan  negotiated by the un and arab leagues special envoy on the syrian crisis kofi annan  syrian troops were to have completed their withdrawal from population centres and stopped the use of heavy weaponry by tuesday ahead of a full ceasefire coming into place on thursday damascus had agreed to the deadline but on sunday demanded written guarantees first that its opponents would give up arms along with a promise from foreign states not to fund them continue reading the main story mr muallems suggestion that a ceasefire should coincide with the arrival of international peace monitors is getting things completely out of the sequence envisaged by kofi annan that called for the government to take the first step in pulling back its forces and the opposition would follow suit in applying a ceasefire by thursday morning the observers would then come in to monitor an existing peace not be part of the stabilisation process in terms of going into a combat situation and trying to calm it themselves it indicates to me there is no clear way forward coming out of the meetings unless there are things that have been decided behind the scenes everybody recognises the annan peace plan went as far as anybody could go in providing a balanced peaceful political solution if this doesnt work its very hard to see how any other plan could speaking after talks with his russian counterpart mr muallem said army units had been withdrawn from some areas a number of detainees released and agreement reached on getting humanitarian aid to those in need but he said that despite all these positive measures we noticed on a daily basis the escalation of opposition by the armed terrorist gangs the significance of these events cannot be overstated said norml a prolegalization organization in a news release tonight for the first time in history two states have legalized and regulated the adult use and sale of cannabis but in many ways its just the beginning of the battle marijuana is still illegal in the eyes of the federal government which overrules states rights the voters have spoken and we have to respect their will said colorado gov john hickenlooper in a statement this is a complicated process but we intend to follow through that said federal law still says marijuana is an illegal drug so dont break out the cheetos or goldfish too quickly the drug enforcement administration reiterated its stance that marijuana is an illegal drug and that possessing using or selling it is a crime the drug enforcement administrations enforcement of the controlled substances act remains unchanged said the dea in a press statement in enacting the controlled substances act congress determined that marijuana is a schedule i controled substance the department of justice is reviewing the ballot initiatives and we have no additional comment at this time the colorado us attorneys office released an identical statement saying that its position on marijuana as an illegal drug is unchanged the voter approval of legal weed in colorado and washington could lead to a supreme court battle with the federal government according to jeffrey miron senior lecturer of economics at harvard university and a senior fellow at the cato institute where he has conducted economic studies on nationwide drug legalization the feds will do whatever they can to interfere with marijuana legalization in any state miron said on tuesday before the initiatives passed analysts had projected the washington voters would approve their legalization ballot because it proposes a heavy tax for marijuana that made the proposal attractive to budget hawks the washington initiative calls for a  tax rate imposed on the product three times when the grower sells it to the processor when the processor sells it to the retailer and when the retailer sells it

said sunday as opposition activists reported at least  deaths in the restive nation unarab league special envoy kofi annan has said that he expects regime forces to withdraw its forces from urban areas by tuesday at which time rebel fighters would also adhere to a ceasefire as part of a peace plan he helped broker but jihad maqdisi a syrian foreign ministry spokesman said that is a wrong interpretation of syrias intentions the staterun syrian arab news agency reported while insisting the damascus government has acted in good faith maqdisi put the onus on annan for the peace plan to proceed  saying the envoy has not offered written guarantees to the syrian government that the armed groups agreed to stop violence nor has he offered guarantees that qatar saudi arabia and turkey will commit to stop funding and arming terrorist groups and in a statement on staterun tv maqdisi said syria will not repeat what happened during the arab league mission when it committed to the exit of its armed forces from the cities and surrounding areas then the armed terrorist groups took advantage to arm its members and conduct all forms of terrorism the statement referred to an arab league monitoring mission that took place several months ago calling president bashar alassad a liar activist ahmad elkhalaf told cnn on monday that he has no faith syrian forces will leave and stop the violence he described the situation in his country and specifically in idlib province where he is as outrageous  with people having little food to eat or water to drink and living in constant fear

together to advance the common good and respect for human rights the pope said in his urbi et orbi to the city and to the world message in st peters square particularly in syria may there be an end to

syria on friday and called for un bodies to consider a recent report detailing the abuses and take appropriate action the council passed a resolution that strongly condemns the continued widespread systematic and gross violations of human rights and fundamental freedoms by the syrian authorities such as arbitrary executions excessive use of force and the killing and persecution of protesters human rights defenders and journalists arbitrary detention enforced disappearances torture and illtreatment including against children there were  yes votes four against and six abstentions at the meeting in geneva switzerland the group convened to consider action against syria after a troubling report issued monday by the independent international commission of inquiry a body appointed by the council that report concluded security and military forces committed crimes against humanity against civilians the resolution recommends that un bodies urgently consider the commission report and take appropriate action the group decided to send the commission of inquiry report to un secretarygeneral ban kimoon for appropriate action and transmission to all un relevant bodies it backs efforts to protect the population of the syrian arab republic and to bring an immediate end to gross human rights violations and it urged syria to protect its population and to immediately put an end to all human rights violations the resolution also decided to establish a mandate of a special rapporteur on the situation of human rights in syria and urges syria to cooperate with it before the resolution was adopted un high commissioner for human rights navi pillay told the council syria faces a fullfledged civil war if the regimes continual ruthless repression against peaceful demonstrators and civilians isnt stopped now she noted with concern the reports of increased armed attacks by the opposition forces including the socalled free syrian army against the syrian military and security apparatus in light of the manifest failure of the syrian authorities to protect their citizens the international community needs to take urgent and effective measures to protect the syrian people pillay said hundreds of syrians have fled coastal areas where activists say government forces have carried out massacres in a campaign of sectarian cleansing video footage of mutilated and burned bodies allegedly from the town of baniyas has been posted online activists said at least  people   from the same family  were killed a day after  died in nearby albayda the government said it had fought back terrorist groups and restored peace and security to the area continue reading the main story its hard to know whether these atrocities are part of a plan of some sort or simply part of the ebb and flow of action and reaction as the struggle for control of syria intensifies what activists omit to say is that there was fighting in the area before the village of albayda was overrun by government forces and militia on thursday some activist footage posted on the internet shows men in military fatigues with walkietalkies presumably rebel fighters milling round in streets strewn with the bodies of young men who look as though they are the victims of summary executions the syrian observatory for human rights says there were clashes there and soldiers were killed before army and militia forces finally stormed in that in no way justifies the apparent massacre of women and children but there is a distinction between brutal reaction and spontaneous execution of a coldblooded plan to displace the sunni population the accusation levelled by opposition leaders reportedly including the chief of staff of the free syrian army general selim idris is that this was part of a campaign of sectarian cleansing ordered from the top in preparation for the establishment of some kind of alawite entity its impossible to know whether there is such a plan but on the ground events seem to be bringing about an unscrambling of populations as happened during the years of civil war in neighbouring lebanon meanwhile israel has said its warplanes carried out an air strike on syria targeting weapons heading to lebanons hezbollah it is the second time this year that the israelis have carried out such strikes there was no official comment from israel on the strikes but it has repeatedly said it would act if it felt syrian weapons were being transferred to militant groups in the region including hezbollah activists have reported two massacres in two days in the coastal area

residents after a truce was agreed the observatory  which has a network of informants on the ground  said the truce was negotiated by local officials the group also reported the bombings in homs

dropped after assad pledged to destroy his chemical weapons arsenal but the syrian government failed to meet a february  deadline to move all of its declared chemical substances and precursors some  metric tons out of the country syria has since agreed to remove the weapons by late april maaloula syria syrian government troops seized at least three border communities including an ancient christian hamlet north of damascus on monday state media and activists said in a dramatic oneday sweep that suggests rebel strongholds along the lebanese frontier are near total collapse the capture of sarkha maaloula and jibbeh was the fastest series of army successes against rebels in the qalamoun region along the border with lebanon since the government launched an offensive in the mountainous terrain in november the government gains have allowed the military backed by the lebanese shiite militant hezbollah group to squeeze a key rebel supply route that has long funneled weapons supplies and fighters to rural damascus syrias state news agency said forces loyal to president bashar assad captured sarkha early monday before also sweeping rebels out of maaloula an ancient christian village set into the rocky hills hours later a syrian military commander said troops also seized the nearby town of jibbeh the seizure of the border communities came a day after government troops backed by hezbollah fighters captured the nearby town of rankous by monday afternoon only the towns of arsal alward hawsh arab and jbaadin remained in rebel hands said the commander who spoke to an associated press reporter on a governmentled tour of the area he spoke on condition of anonymity in line with regulations a prorebel activist in qalamoun who uses the name amer confirmed the military had taken the communities but said jibbeh and jbaadin had never been in opposition hands the britainbased syrian observatory for human rights confirmed that both communities had never been under rebel control instead it appeared that progovernment fighters had preemptively seized the towns to ensure rebels would not take them now in its fourth year syrias civil war has killed more than  people and taken on deep sectarian overtones the armed opposition is dominated by syrias sunni muslim majority islamic extremists including foreign fighters and syrian rebels who have taken up hardline

main story while the lifting of the eu arms embargo is theoretically good news for the fractious syrian opposition it is clearly going to be some time before it has any effect on the battlefield its authors especially britain hope the decision itself will send a strong enough signal to president bashar alassad that it is time to hand over power that is extremely unlikely for a government that has shown every sign of determination to fight to the end it is hard facts on the ground that count government forces have recently been making significant gains to reverse that trend will take time and sacrifice by the rebels  and the kind of quality weapons they have so far been denied especially armourpiercing and antiaircraft projectiles the americans in particular insist that muchneeded shoulderfired groundtoair missiles must not be given lest they end up with extremists but for the rebels at least the eventual possibility of carefullycontrolled arms deliveries is there in what looks like being a bloody longhaul struggle the eu declaration on syria came after  hours of talks in brussels foreign ministers were unable to reach the unanimous decision required to extend the current arms embargo and so agreed to renew the other sanctions  including an assets freeze on president assad and his aides and restrictions on trade in oil and financial transactions  without it the bbcs

controlled by antigovernment rebels some republican critics of obamas handling of the syria crisis have been advocating international enforcement of a nofly zone to prevent syrian warplanes from operating over designated zones as well as more directly arming the opposition forces fighting to overthrow president bashar alassad the united states has so far declined to provide weapons directly

deal with certain circumstances said john brennan obamas senior counterterrorism adviser so rest assured that various options that are being talked about in the press and sometimes being advocated these are things that the united states government has been looking at very carefully trying to understand the implications trying to understand the advantages and the disadvantages he said asked

both sides to attend a proposed peace conference in the coming weeks with assads fortunes on the rise and the opposition in disarray signaling the diplomatic difficulties international envoy for syria lakhdar brahimi said in geneva that the date for the conference had slipped back to july from june the only sticking point is  the syrian component of the conference he said after meeting us and

wednesday syrian state tv claimed that government forces had gained full control of qusair there was no way of immediately verifying the claim which was also reported by hezbollahs almanar tv channel gen idriss also said the rebels would not accept any role for president bashar alassad in a postconflict syria if the price of peace is that bashar still has the power in syria we dont need that kind of peace he said he said he had told commanders including those near the strategic town of qusair to fight hezbollah militants just inside syria but he added there are now a very large number of hezbollah fighters in syria in qusair in idlib in aleppo in damascus and i can say everywhere in the country hezbollah fighters are invading syrian territory and when they continue to do that and the lebanese authorities dont take any action to stop them coming to syria i think we are allowed to fight hezbollah fighters inside lebanese territory the syrian government hailed a strategic victory on

the government here is wary of being drawn into a messy power struggle in syria which has no clear outcome many crossed the border but a significant number opted to camp on the syrian side of the

syria which are government tanks and soldiers shooting peaceful demonstrators she said there must be a legitimate sincere effort with the opposition to try to make changes she said i dont know whether that will happen or not some opposition members were frustrated at what they perceived as a lack of response from the international community and hoped that a united syrian opposition would ratchet up pressure on alassad the international community seems to be still dancing around the issue of the assad regime losing legitimacy and that could be due to a number of reasons said m yaser tabbara a

rear base near the border with lebanon it also comes amid intense international efforts to hold a geneva peace conference aimed at ending the month conflict the opposition demands any talks should
